# Automated workflow scripts

!!! bug
		There are currently known bugs in the following do scripts.
		Until we can fix them, we suggest that you either: i) directly use the `edm` commands as per the examples on this site, ii) use the scripts as an inspiration for your do files, or iii) help us track down the bugs with a pull request to [https://github.com/EDM-Developers/EDM/](https://github.com/EDM-Developers/EDM/).

Linked below are some Stata scripts using `edm` which automate some common analyses.
They provide some early stage prototypes allowing automated Simplex Projections, S-maps, Coprediction, and Convergent Cross Mapping as well as relevant hypothesis tests:

- [edm Plugin - Automated time-series analysis (N=1 case)](workflows/1._EDM_for_N_of_1-traditional_time-series_case.do)
- [edm Plugin - Automated multi-spatial analysis (N>1 panel data case)](workflows/2._Multispatial_edm-pooling_panel_IDs_together.do)
- [edm Plugin - Automated multiple-edm analysis (N>1 panel data case)](workflows/3._Multiple_EDM-analyze_each_panel_ID_separately.do)
