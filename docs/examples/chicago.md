# Chicago crime/temperature example

To demonstrate the usefulness of EDM in estimating the impact of causal variables, we use a real-world dataset that reflects
daily temperature and crime levels in Chicago, which we make available in the [chicago.dta](chicago.dta) file.

## The data


First, we load the time series from the `chicago.dta` file:

```` stata
. use chicago, clear

````

Plotting the data gives:

```` stata
. scatter crime temp

````
![Scatterplot of Chicago number of crimes against temperature](chicago-scatter.svg)

A linear correlation of the dataset... 

```` stata
. corr crime temp
(obs=4,371)

             |    crime     temp
-------------+------------------
       crime |   1.0000
        temp |   0.4620   1.0000


````

shows a mild correlation, however the causal structure (if any) and its direction is not shown.

## Find the optimal embedding dimension

Now we use `edm explore` to find the optimal embedding dimension of the $\texttt{Temperature}$ time series.
We check the values of $E = 2, \dots 20$.
The `crossfold(5)` option means that, for each $E$ value we run 5 sets of predictions, and for each set we take four fifths of the data for training and predict the remaining one fifth.

```` stata
. edm explore temp, e(2/20) crossfold(5)
5-fold cross-validation progress (5 in total)
Percent complete: 0...10...20...30...40...50...60...70...80...90...

From the `rho` column we can see that the prediction accuracy is maximised when $E = 7$, so we take this as our estimate of the embedding dimension.

## Convergent cross-mapping

The `edm xmap` command will run the cross-mapping task, which allows us to ascertain the causal links between the crime and temperature time series.

```` stata
. qui edm xmap temp crime, e(7) rep(4) ///
>         library(10(5)200 210(10)1000 1020(20)2000 2050(50)4350 4365) 

````

!!! note
        This selects a lot of library points, and replicates the analysis some times, so this command may take a minute or two to finish.
        Choosing a machine with more CPU cores or faster cores will help significantly.   

Plotting the results gives:


```` stata
. mat cyx = e(xmap_2)

. mat cxy = e(xmap_1)

. svmat cyx, names(chicago_yx)

. svmat cxy, names(chicago_xy)

. label variable chicago_xy3 "Crime|M(Temperature)"

. label variable chicago_yx3 "Temperature|M(Crime)"

. twoway (scatter chicago_xy3 chicago_xy2, mfcolor(%30) mlcolor(%30)) ///
>     (scatter chicago_yx3 chicago_yx2, mfcolor(%30) mlcolor(%30)) ///
>     (lpoly chicago_xy3 chicago_xy2)(lpoly chicago_yx3 chicago_yx2), ///
>         xtitle(L) ytitle("{it:{&rho}}") legend(col(1))

. drop chicago_xy* chicago_yx*

````
![Convergent cross-mapping plot of accuracy against library size](chicago-rho-L.svg)

In this plot, we can see that one direction shows a significant increase in accuracy as $L$ increases, whereas the other direction is pretty flat.
The direction which increases the most is the $\texttt{Temperature} \mid M(\texttt{Crime})$ direction.
This notation means we used  $\texttt{Crime}$ to predict $\texttt{Temperature}$, and due to the backward nature of EDM means it refers to the causal link $\texttt{Temperature} \to M(\texttt{Crime})$.
Therefore, we'd conclude that there is a causal link from temperature to crime, though no link in the reverse direction (which would be implausible).  

## Inspecting the S-map coefficients 

If we run `xmap` with the `savesmap(beta)` option, we can store the fitted S-map coefficients into variable which start with the prefix `beta`.

```` stata
. edm xmap temp crime, e(7) alg(smap) k(-1) savesmap(beta)
Percent complete: 0...10...20...30...40...50...60...70...80...90...
Percent complete: 0...10...20...30...40...50...60...70...80...90...
